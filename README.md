# Tic-tac-toe-Human-Phone.A js challange:
 "Make js file,don't touch CSS or html ! Bulid a tic,tac,toe vs Pc/
phone,with winn and draw alert,a winning-array,hover-efect for human player with mouseover/mouseout,and a reset function.Google ok,GPT NOT!"

My first Tic,Tac,toe during the js challange.I try'd 'manually reset',but some Android device show the hover image/color after restart VS 'window.location.reload().It got a few key functions different from script below and stay for learning and a memory:
